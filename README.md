# Titanic Survival Prediction – Competitive ML Pipeline

This project is an end-to-end machine learning pipeline inspired by competitive ML workflows (Kaggle-style) and real-world ML engineering practices.

## Problem Framing
Predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster using structured tabular data.  
The task involves handling missing data, feature engineering, model selection, and robust evaluation.

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle Titanic Dataset
- Size: ~900 training samples
- Features: Passenger class, gender, age, family relations, fare, embark location

## ML Workflow
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
2. Missing value imputation (Age, Fare, Embarked)
3. Feature encoding using one-hot encoding
4. Baseline model: Logistic Regression
5. Advanced model: Random Forest Classifier
6. Cross-validation for robust evaluation
7. Feature importance analysis

## Models & Evaluation
- Logistic Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest (non-linear model)
- 5-fold Cross Validation
- Accuracy-based evaluation
- Feature importance visualization

## Key ML Concepts Demonstrated
- Model comparison and trade-offs
- Bias awareness (gender-based survival patterns)
- Reproducible experimentation
- Data-driven decision making

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Why This Project Matters
This project simulates how machine learning engineers frame problems, evaluate models, and iterate — aligning with expectations from applied ML roles at companies like Mercor, Microsoft, and Amazon.
